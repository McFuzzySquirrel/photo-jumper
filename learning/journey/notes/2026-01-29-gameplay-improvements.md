# Session Notes — 2026-01-29

## People
- Learner: My son
- Coach: Doug McCusker (McFuzzySquirrel)

## Goals for this session
- To review the feedback he submitted and make a plan to to implement, this included making improvements to image detection and adding movement controls when playin on mobile device.
- To review the feedback about allowing for a full screen experience.

## What we discussed
- So since we have now added both custom instructions and prompts, we thought it would be a good idea to also create an issues template that copilot could understand.
- His ideas were awesome, and we decided to tackle them one-by-one, making the first change, testing it and then making the second change and testing it.

## What we decided
- Create issue template
- Take feedback and create issue that we could assign to a copilot agent, one for each feedback received.
- Test the changes and make sure we update the ADR, this is always good, both for our own changes and the changes the copliot makes.
- Once happy with the changes, we will merge back into the learning/journey branch.

## What we built / changed
- Improved mobile gameplay experience by adding controls
- Improved both mobile and web gameplay experience by having better image detection.
- I added a more interactive way of creating these notes (scope creep)

## Key takeaways
- Listening to feedback and deciding what changes to make is critical
- Tackle changes one-by-one, dont try to boil the ocean
- Always make sure you test the branch changes before merging
- Working and learning together is great

## Open questions
- None

## Next steps (concrete)
- [ ] Test improvements
- [ ] Test mobile controls
- [ ] Test full screen capabilities
- [ ] Merge to learning/journey branch when we are happy
