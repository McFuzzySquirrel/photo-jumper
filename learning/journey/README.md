# Learning Journey

This folder is our shared record of what we discussed, what we decided, and what we plan to do next.

## How to use this

- Add a new session note in `notes/` each time we talk.
  - Naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD.md` (or `YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md` if you prefer).
- Record durable decisions in `decisions.md` so they’re easy to find later.
- When you start a new session, copy `templates/session-note-template.md`.

## Suggested workflow

1. Create a new note for today in `notes/`.
2. Write what we did + what we learned.
3. Capture any decisions (and why) in `decisions.md`.
4. End with concrete next steps.
