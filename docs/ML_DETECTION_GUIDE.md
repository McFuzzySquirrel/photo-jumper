# ML Object Detection - Expected Behavior

## Why You Might Not See Different Platforms

The ML detection feature is **working correctly**, but it only creates platforms from specific objects. Here's what's happening:

### What ML Detection Does

1. **Scans your photo** for 80 different object types (COCO dataset)
2. **Filters for "platformable" objects** (furniture, vehicles, electronics)
3. **Creates platforms** from those objects only
4. **Falls back to grid-based detection** for everything else

### Platformable Objects

ML detection ONLY creates platforms from these objects:

**Furniture (7):**
- bench, chair, couch, bed, dining table, desk, toilet

**Electronics (9):**
- tv, laptop, keyboard, book, microwave, oven, toaster, sink, refrigerator

**Vehicles (8):**
- car, bus, truck, boat, train, airplane, bicycle, motorcycle

**Sports Equipment (4):**
- skateboard, surfboard, snowboard, skis

**Containers (3):**
- vase, potted plant, bowl

**Animals (10):**
- bird, cat, dog, horse, sheep, cow, elephant, bear, zebra, giraffe

**People (1):**
- person

**Other (9):**
- suitcase, backpack, clock, teddy bear, remote, mouse, cell phone

**Total: 51 platformable object types**

### Why You See the Same Platforms

If your test photo doesn't contain these objects, ML detection won't create any ML-specific platforms. The game will fall back to the **grid-based detection** (which works on all photos).

**Example scenarios:**

❌ **Photo of landscape** → 0 platformable objects → Same as grid-based
❌ **Photo of food only** → 0 platformable objects → Same as grid-based  
✅ **Photo of living room** → chairs, couch, tv → Different platforms!
✅ **Photo of office** → desk, laptop, chair → Different platforms!
✅ **Photo of parking lot** → cars, trucks, bus → Different platforms!
✅ **Photo with pets** → cats, dogs → Animal platforms!
✅ **Zoo photo** → elephants, giraffes → Exotic platforms!
✅ **Family photo** → people → Jump on heads!

## How to Test ML Detection

### Step 1: Enable Debug Overlay

1. Upload a photo
2. Check "Debug overlay" checkbox
3. Check "ML object detection" checkbox

### Step 2: Check Console

Open DevTools (F12) → Console tab. You'll see:

```
🤖 Running ML object detection...
ONNX inference completed in 2345ms
ML detection found 5 total objects
Detected objects: person (95.2%) ✗ not platformable, chair (87.3%) ✓ platformable, couch (82.1%) ✓ platformable
2 of those are platformable
```

### Step 3: Look for ML Objects in Debug Overlay

- **Green boxes** = Platformable objects (will create platforms)
- **Orange boxes** = Detected but not platformable (won't create platforms)

## When ML Makes a Difference

ML detection is most useful for photos containing:

### ✅ Good Test Photos:
- **Office/workspace** - desks, chairs, laptops, keyboards
- **Living room** - couches, chairs, TV stands
- **Kitchen** - refrigerator, oven, microwave, sink
- **Parking lot / street** - cars, trucks, buses
- **Airport / station** - trains, airplanes, benches
- **Pet photos** - cats, dogs (stand on animals!)
- **Zoo/wildlife** - elephants, giraffes, zebras, bears
- **Farm** - horses, cows, sheep
- **Family/group photos** - people (jump on heads!)
- **Sports/outdoor** - bicycles, motorcycles, skateboards, surfboards

### ❌ Poor Test Photos:
- **Pure nature scenes** - trees, grass, sky (no animals)
- **Abstract patterns** - no recognizable objects
- **Close-ups of food** - pizza, sandwiches (unless on a table/plate)
- **Empty rooms** - just walls and floors

## Technical Details

### Segmentation (Implemented)

YOLOv8n-seg is the current interim ML model. When the segmentation model is loaded
(from `models/yolov8n-seg.onnx`), it provides instance segmentation masks that are
converted into stepped, block-aligned platforms following object contours. This
produces more natural-feeling platforms than bounding-box-only detection.

YOLOE-26n-seg is the long-term target model. It will replace YOLOv8n-seg once
available on a public CDN.

If the segmentation model is not available, the pipeline falls back to the
bounding-box-only YOLOv8n model (loaded from CDN).

### Why These Specific Objects?

These objects typically have **detectable boundaries** that can serve as platform surfaces:
- Furniture → sit/stand on top
- Cars → stand on roof
- Laptops → stand on top
- Animals → jump on their backs (video game logic!)
- People → Mario-style head jumping

Objects are detected based on what the YOLOv8 model can recognize in the COCO dataset (80 common objects).

### Confidence Threshold

- Default: 30% confidence required (0.3)
- Lower threshold = more detections (but more false positives)
- Current setting is tuned for recall over precision

### Platform Generation

**With segmentation model (YOLOv8n-seg):**
1. Run inference → get bounding boxes + 32 mask coefficients per object + 160×160 prototype masks
2. Multiply mask coefficients by prototype masks → apply sigmoid → instance masks
3. Extract top contour from each mask (scan each column top-to-bottom)
4. Convert contours to stepped, block-aligned platforms (20px grid)
5. Merge nearby platforms and exclude reserved zones (start, goal, word bar)
6. Combine with grid-based platforms (fill gaps)

**With bounding-box model (YOLOv8n fallback):**
1. Get bounding box (x, y, width, height) for each platformable object
2. Calculate top surface (y coordinate)
3. Create platform from top edge
4. Merge with nearby ML platforms
5. Combine with grid-based platforms (fill gaps)

## Debugging Tips

### If you see "No objects detected":
- Photo doesn't contain any of the 80 COCO classes
- Or objects are too small
- Or confidence too low

### If you see "X objects (none platformable)":
- ML detected things like people, trees, animals
- But none are furniture/vehicles/electronics
- Enable debug overlay to see what was detected (orange boxes)

### If you see "X objects → platforms":
- ML found platformable objects!
- Platforms created from those objects
- Should look different from grid-based detection
- Green boxes show detected objects

## Recommendation

**For best ML results, use photos of:**
1. **Your desk/workspace** - lots of electronics
2. **Your living room** - furniture galore  
3. **A parking lot** - cars make great platforms
4. **Your kitchen** - appliances everywhere
5. **Your pets** - cats and dogs as platforms
6. **Zoo/wildlife** - exotic animal platforms
7. **Family gatherings** - people platforms!

**Avoid:**
1. Pure landscapes (no animals/objects)
2. Abstract art
3. Food close-ups (unless on furniture)
4. Empty rooms

---

**TL;DR:** ML detection works, and now detects **51 object types** including furniture, vehicles, electronics, animals, and people! If your photo has cats, dogs, elephants, or people, you'll get animal/person platforms. Try a photo of your pets or a zoo visit to see the difference!
