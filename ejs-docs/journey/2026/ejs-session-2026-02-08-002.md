# Problem / Intent

Implement ML-only mode for platform generation in the Photo Jumper game. Requirements:
- Add ML-only mode flag/toggle so platform generation uses ML detections (plus ML-sparse fallback chain) without grid-based platforms
- Cap helper platforms for gap bridging to 2 blocks wide in ML-only mode
- Retain reachability validation (BFS) and helper insertion
- Preserve gameplay constraints (jump limits, block grid)

# Interaction Summary (Required)

- Human: Implement ML-only mode with 2-block helper cap issue
  - Agent: Initialized EJS session and exploring repository structure
  - Outcome: Session Journey created, beginning code exploration

# Agent Collaboration Summary
